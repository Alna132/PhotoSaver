# PhotoSaver
PhotoSaver is an app where you can take a photo and either save it to your phone or send it to yourself in an email. This means that you can make sure that you don't loose any precious moments because of a lack of memory space on the phone.

## Using the App
The main page has a map, which after pressing the location button at the bottom of the screen, will show you your current location.
The camera button will bring you over tho the second page of the app.

The camera will allow the user to take a photo once the capture button is pressed.
Then there is the option of saving the photo anywhere on the phone.
Once the photo is saved the photo can be sent by pressing the email button on the camera page. 

This will bring you to a page where you can email the photo to yourself for safe keeping, or to anyone else.
Finally you will be brought to a confirmation page, letting you know that the image has been stored away.

Currently a photo must be saved on the phone before it can be emailed. 
But future updates will bypass that and send the image straigt to the email.
